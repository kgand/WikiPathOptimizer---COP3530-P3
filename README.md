## Problem Statement
Our project addresses and aims to optimize the seemingly endless navigation paths through Wikipedia articles by searching for the most efficient pathway by comparing pathfinding algorithms.

## Motivation
We seek to determine whether BFS or DFS has a better performance when using a data structure with a large dataset. This will help optimize search algorithms for graph traversal in various applications.

## Features
- Find the most efficient pathway from one Wikipedia article to another.
- Compare efficiency of human paths with algorithmically found paths.
- Metrics: Time complexity, space usage, path length, success rate, system response time, accuracy, memory optimization.

## Data
- **Dataset:** Wikispeedia Data
- **Nodes:** 4,604 Wikipedia articles
- **Edges:** 119,882 navigation paths

## Tools
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Libraries:** STL, Boost Graph Library (BGL), LEMON, Gnuplot, Matplot++

## Strategy
- Represent data using a graph.
- Implement BFS and DFS algorithms for pathfinding.
- Compare algorithm performance based on various metrics.
